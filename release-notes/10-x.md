# Release Notes for PROSE SDK versions 10.x

- **We no longer support .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.6.**

## [Release 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.0.0) - 2024-07-23
- ConditionalFormatting
  - Added new templates for data divided by month names for better localization for nominative and locative case.
  - Made target column index nullable. When not specified, it will infer the target column on its own.
  - (Suggestions) Changed date descriptions to `GenetiveMonthNames` instead of `MonthNames`.

- Matching.Text
  - Add `MergeSimilarClusters` constraint that attempts to make output less noisy by combining similar looking patterns.
  - Added `UnicodeTokens` parallel to `DefaultTokens` with variants of some of the default tokens using Unicode character classes instead of covering just ASCII.
