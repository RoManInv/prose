## [Release 8.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/8.2.0) - 2021/09/28
- Detection
  - Fixed bug around Precision and Scale being present on RichNumericType on non-uniform data (contrary to the docs).
  - Added MaxPrecision and MaxScale to RichNumericType for the maximal scale and precision encountered in the data.
  
- Transformation.Formula
  - Transformation.Formula is now part of the public PROSE SDK.

## [Release 8.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/8.1.0) - 2021/08/23
- Extraction.Json
  - Fixed StackOverflowException on certain very large JSON files.

- Common

  - Fixed bug in serialization of trees.

## [Release 8.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/8.0.0) - 2021/07/26
- Transformation.Text
  - Added a new translation telemetry event called "TranslateAnomaly" to report issues during translation instead of throwing exceptions.
  - Fixed race condition where multiple simultaneous learns on the same language could cause some witness functions to never get executed, making learning incomplete or throw exceptions in rare cases
  - Breaking Change in API for translating to python and specifying input rows for examples.
  - Change constructor for Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis.Wrangling.Example to accept an object as the output parameter instead of just a string.
  - Added constraint: AvoidImperialDateTimeFormat. When this constraint is present European style date formats (d/m/yyyy) will be avoided in the learning process.

- Extraction.Text
  - Example no longer claims to conflict with all non-Example constraints.

- Common
  - Made the default witness function for ConversionRule handle InductiveConstraints automatically (previously an exception would be thrown).
